Marketing analysis project:
SQL Functions Used
To clean, join, and filter the marketing data before visualization in Power BI:
â€¢	JOIN â€“ to merge tables such as product info, campaign data, and customer interactions.
â€¢	GROUP BY â€“ to aggregate sales and engagement metrics by product, time, or platform.
â€¢	CASE WHEN â€“ for conditional labeling (e.g., categorizing engagement scores).
â€¢	DATEPART() / CONVERT() / CAST() â€“ for date formatting and extracting insights by day, month, or year.
â€¢	ISNULL() or COALESCE() â€“ to handle missing or null values in the dataset.
â€¢	RANK() / ROW_NUMBER() â€“ to identify top-performing products or campaigns.
â€¢	Subqueries â€“ to calculate metrics like average campaign performance or customer conversion rate.

o	stopwords â€“ for filtering out non-informative words.
o	word_tokenize() â€“ to break down reviews into individual words.
â€¢	Sentiment Analysis:
o	TextBlob â€“ for basic polarity and subjectivity scoring.
